# Simulations of quantum transport in nanoscopic systems

Laboratory classes solving quantum transport problems.
In most cases C++ is used along with cmake.
To build project inside directory do
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Data should be saved at `data/` directory after every run.
Also reports are stored here.
